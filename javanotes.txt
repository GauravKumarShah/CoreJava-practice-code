A computer language is a system of communication with a computer. Types of computer languages include these:

Programming language, a formal language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer
General-purpose language, a programming language that is broadly applicable across application domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain
Command language, a language used to control the tasks of the computer itself, such as starting other programs
Machine language or machine code, a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit
Assembly language, a language closely related to one or a family of machine languages, and which uses mnemonics to ease writing
Markup language, a language closely related to one or a family of machine languages, and which uses mnemonics to ease writing
Markup language, a grammar for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, such as HTML
Style sheet language, a computer language that expresses the presentation of structured documents, such as CSS
Configuration language, a language used to write configuration files
Construction language, a general category that includes configuration languages, toolkit languages, and programming languages
Query language, a language used to make queries in databases and information systems
Modeling language, a formal language used to express information or knowledge, often for use in computer system design
Hardware description anguage, used to model integrated circuits
Simulation language, a language used to describe simulations We can save java file name with any name and we can compile it also but compiler will create a class file with the same name of our class name which we provided at the time of writing the program.



So at runtime  we have to use the same name of our class name instead of the name which we provided at the time of writing the program. 

because at runtime JVM will find the class file not java file We use System.out.println(): line to print any statement or refer to any variable , method etc to get their value

class Demo
{
	public static void main(String []args)
	{
	System.out.println("");
	}
}



We use System.out.println(): line to print any statement or refer to any variable , method etc to get their value

class Example
{
	public static void main(String [] args)
	{
	System.out.println("\t\tJava");
	System.out.println("Android\t\t\t\tC++");
	System.out.println("\t\tC#");
	}
}

				do while
	notes :- 	do while loop always executes once whether condition is false. Because conditional statement check at the last of the do while . 
class Gaurav
{
	public static void main(String []args)
	{
	int i = 10;
		do
		{
		System.out.println(i);
		i=i+1;
		}while(i<10);
	}
}

Opearotrs are used to perform operations on operands while executing program.an operand can be a variable or another values.
an operand can be a variable or another values.sign :-    =  Arithmetic Operatores:=
+,-,*,/,%

Note :- / (Divide) and % (Modulus) both are used for divide operations but / (Divide) gives us Qutioent and %(Modulus) gives us Remainder.


Unary Operators: Unary operators needs only one operand. They are used to increment, decrement or negate a value.
	– :Unary minus, used for negating the values.
	+ :Unary plus, used for giving positive values. Only used when deliberately converting a negative value to positive.
		++ :Increment operator, used for incrementing the value by 1. There are two varieties of increment operator.
			Post-Increment : Value is first used for computing the result and then incremented.
			Pre-Increment : Value is incremented first and then result is computed.
		— : Decrement operator, used for decrementing the value by 1. There are two varieties of decrement operator.
			Post-decrement : Value is first used for computing the result and then decremented.
			Pre-Decrement : Value is decremented first and then result is computed.
